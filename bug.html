The following code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a button, but the button does not appear as expected. The background color is not applied correctly, the text color appears wrong, and the padding is not consistent.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```
