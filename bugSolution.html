The issue was caused by a conflict between Tailwind's default styles and custom styles that might have been applied in an earlier part of the CSS or JS. Also, incorrect use of Tailwind classes is possible. Here is the corrected code:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

This corrected code ensures that the button styling is applied correctly.  If the issue persists, check for conflicting CSS rules or ensure that Tailwind CSS is properly configured and included in your project.
